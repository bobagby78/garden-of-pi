# garden-of-pi
automated garden with raspi

The garden of Pi is my first major project using a Raspberry Pi and the python programming language to regulate
optimal growing conditions for a crop starter nursery for a home vegetable garden. 

Using an arduino microcontroller to measure temperature, soil humidity, and CO2 levels, the Garden of Pi can be used to
automatically enable and disable all of the lif support mechanisms for plants, to an extent.
